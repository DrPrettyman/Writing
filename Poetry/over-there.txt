# Over there

You are all the way over there
and here am I
rooted, somehow, but I see your place
over there

I don't think you can see me
clearly
not really

"I love you" I say
"Fuck you" you say
and I don't know what it was...

maybe I tried to kiss you
—a lapse of judgement—
gently on your lips
at some inappropriate moment such as when
you were busy
very busy
staring and scrolling in the blue light
and I'm sorry
very sorry
there will be no kissing tonight

but your skin touches mine
—I still feel your heat—
accidentally
beneath the sheet
